# The usage of git command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qingxiangguo/qingxiangguo.git # clone a repo from git to local

git status

git add . # add all to the tree space

git commit -m "update"

git push origin main # The master has all been changed to main now

# The origin is the local place, the main(used to be master) is the main branch on the remote, you can 
# add and merge and switch between main branch and sub-branch

# If you want to delete something

rm -r ./*

git rm . # update the removal
```
