# Nox: A Brief Guide

## Introduction

Nox is a powerful Python automation tool, used extensively for testing across multiple environments. This guide will walk you through its basic usage and integration with GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI).

## Installation

```bash
pip install nox
```

## Defining Sessions

In `noxfile.py`, define sessions using the `@nox.session` decorator:

```python
import nox

@nox.session(python=["3.8", "3.9"])
def tests(session):
    session.run("poetry", "install", external=True)
    session.run("pytest")
```

## Running Nox

To run all sessions:

```bash
nox
```

To run a specific session:

```bash
nox -s tests
```

## Integration with GitHub Actions

In your `.github/workflows` directory, create a workflow YAML file:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install Nox
      run: pip install nox

    - name: Run Nox
      run: nox
```

## Conclusion

Nox automates testing across multiple Python environments, simplifying the development process. When combined with GitHub Actions, it provides a robust solution for Continuous Integration, ensuring code quality and compatibility.
